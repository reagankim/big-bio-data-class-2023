        "Numpy is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects such as masked arrays and matrices, and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.\n",

        "\n",
        "Multidimensional array: NumPy's main feature is the ndarray, an efficient multidimensional array that can hold homogeneous data (i.e., all elements must be of the same data type). These arrays can have any number of dimensions and are the basis for most scientific computing tasks in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Broadcasting: NumPy allows for broadcasting, which means that operations can be performed on arrays with different shapes and sizes. Broadcasting can save time and memory by avoiding the need for explicit looping over the array.\n",
        "\n",
        "Vectorization: NumPy provides a way to apply mathematical operations to entire arrays, rather than looping over each element. This makes it much faster and more efficient to perform numerical calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Support for linear algebra: NumPy provides functions for linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiplication, inversion, and solving linear systems of equations.\n"
